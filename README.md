# Vidd thin client
### About

I'm a thin-client designed to help you easily stream video files to <a href="viddai.bitbucket.io">Vidd.ai</a> for processing

+  I resize (and transcode if necessary) files you choose to send to the vidd cloud server for processing  
(   `h265's source files are ok!`)
+  I execute jobs *in parallel* to shorten upload times
(`I run as if in the background with little interference on your desk/laptop`)

+  I've successfully sent files inside of 1-2 minutes per gb of raw footage 
  (`I've been tested with batches of files in the 18-21 gb range with residential ISP upload speeds`)
  
  
### Version

  Currently for MAC OSx and Windows
  (`actively calling for collaborators for Windows`)
