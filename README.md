### About me, the Vidd thin client

I'm a thin-client designed to help you easily stream video files to <a href="viddai.bitbucket.io">Vidd.ai</a> for processing

+  I resize (and transcode if necessary) files you choose to send to the vidd cloud server for processing  
(   `h265's source files are ok!`)
+  I execute jobs *in parallel* to shorten upload times
(`I run as if in the background with little interference on your desk/laptop`)

+  I've successfully sent files inside of 1-2 minutes per gb of raw footage 
  (`I've been tested with batches of files in the 18-21 gb range with residential ISP upload speeds`)
  
  
### Version

  Currently for MAC OSx and Windows
  (`actively calling for collaborators for Windows`)


### Install
1. Download the zip file for your OS

+ [MAC](https://vidd-ai.github.io/streamer-bot/vidd-streamer-bot-darwin-x64.zip)

+ [Windows](https://vidd-ai.github.io/streamer-bot/vidd-streamer-bot-win32-ia32.zip) 

 

2. Unzip the file on your desk/laptop, and click on the vidd-streamer-bot executable. That's it.

 + Windows users *take note*
 
     The very first time you use the vidd-streamer-bot, please enable your anti-virus settings to allow installs.
     (`This is to allow the thin client to install 3 helper apps in the background: curl, ffmpeg, and ffprobe, which it will need.`) 
     
    You can reset to your original anti-virus settings immediately after your very first file uploads (`use the <show status> button to check`).
